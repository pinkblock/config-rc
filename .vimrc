" Important things for beginners:
" * Start out small... Don't jam your vimrc full of things you're not ready to
"   immediately use.
" * Read other people's vimrc's.
" * Use a plugin manager for christ's sake! (I highly recommend vundle)
" * Spend time configuring your editor... It's important. Its the tool you
"   spend 8 hours a day crafting your reputation.
" * remap stupid things to new keys that make you more efficient.
" * Don't listen to the haters that complain about using non-default
"   key-bindings. Their argument is weak. I spend most of my time in the editor
"   on my computer, not others, so I don't care if customizing vim means I'll
"   have a harder time using remote vim.
"
" Below I've left some suggestions of good default settings to have in a bare
" minimal vimrc. You only what you want to use, and nothing more. I've heavily
" commented each, and these are what I consider bare necessities, my workflow
" absolutely depends on these things.
"

" Use sane regex's when searching
nnoremap / /\v
vnoremap / /\v

" Map the key for toggling comments with vim-commentary
nnoremap <leader>c <Plug>CommentaryLine

" Remap ctrlp to ctrl-t -- map it however you like, or stick with the
" defaults. Additionally, in my OS, I remap caps lock to control. I never use
" caps lock. This is highly recommended.
let g:ctrlp_map = '<c-t>'

" Let ctrlp have up to 30 results.
let g:ctrlp_max_height = 30
